# PyFoil

Server for sending games to the switch Awoo Installer (could also work on Tinfoil and others). Figure out yourself, can't be bothered. If you mod awoo installer and use it to broadcast "awoo-discovery" on the local network on port 7777, this program will pick it up and send the games list to it. Otherwise visit the "web ui" on / and you will get a field for the switch's ip
